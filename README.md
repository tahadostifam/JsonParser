# JSON Parser in OCaml

A simple **JSON parser** written in [OCaml 5.6](https://ocaml.org/) for **educational** and **recreational** purposes.  

This project demonstrates:

- Functional programming techniques in OCaml  
- Recursive descent parsing for JSON  
- Building a tiny REPL loop for interactive parsing  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**:  
This parser is intentionally minimal and not designed for production use.  
It lacks advanced features, optimizations, and security hardening required in real-world scenarios.
